## üåå CTP is Disclosure Movement (CTP-IDM) ‚Äì Summary

This repository serves as a live tracker for the public emergence of the **CTP is Disclosure Movement** and the growing awareness of **CTP Energy** and **CTP Energy Sciences** across social media, global news, and cultural discourse.

### üîç What is "CTP is Disclosure"?

The **CTP is Disclosure Movement** is more than just UFOs or recovered craft. It represents the **public awakening to a revolutionary scientific paradigm**: the discovery and emergence of **two additional, non-physical/potential Fundamental Forces** not yet recognized by current physics or quantum theory.

This movement introduces a **new field of postquantum science** ‚Äì one that bridges human consciousness with extraterrestrial intelligence through what is known as **C-domain Intelligence**. This is the **second major release** of these sciences in nearly two decades and marks a pivotal turning point in humanity‚Äôs future.

### üß† Why It Matters

CTP Energy Sciences are **postquantum and non-physical**, offering tools for individuals and humanity to **evolve consciousness**, access **Higher Mind**, and realize new potentials in thought, spirit, and innovation. This is science not just for technology‚Äîbut for **soul-level evolution**, new societal structures, and planetary awakening.

### üöÄ Our Mission

We are documenting the rise of this social movement, its breakthroughs, and global reception. Our aim is to share, archive, and expand the awareness of **CTP is Disclosure** as a global tipping point‚Äîone that redefines science, reality, and the human future. Our goals are to advance humankind, advance human consciousness, pioneer new CTPSci Sciences applications, and achieve interstellar space travel within one generation (or less).
